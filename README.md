Full-Stack Java Developer
-------------------------

I am a **Full-Stack Java developer** currently honing skills at [Coders Campus](https://www.coderscampus.com/) bootcamp.  
  
Eager to take with me strong analytical and communication abilities gained through diverse experiences in **marketing**, **retail management** and **stock analysis** to the software development field.  
Passionate with always learning new software, frameworks and languages, I have taken a course on Figma UI design and I am currently diving into OpenCV and Canvas API for my bootcamp's final project
